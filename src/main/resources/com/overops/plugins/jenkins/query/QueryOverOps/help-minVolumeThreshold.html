<div>
	The minimal number of times an event of a non-critical type (e.g. uncaught) must take place to be 
	considered severe.

	<ul>
		<li>
			If a New event has a count greater than the set value, it will be evaluated as severe and could 
			break the build if its event rate is above the Event Rate Threshold.
		</li>
		<li>
			If an Existing event has a count greater than the set value, it will be evaluated as severe and 
			could break the build if its event rate is above the Event Rate Threshold and the Critical 
			Regression Threshold.
		</li>
		<li>
			If any event has a count less than the set value, it will not be evaluated as severe and will not 
			break the build.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
